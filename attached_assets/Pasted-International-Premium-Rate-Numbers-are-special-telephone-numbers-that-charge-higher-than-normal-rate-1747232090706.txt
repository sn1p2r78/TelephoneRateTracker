how to make panel for premium rate numbers service


ChatGPT said:
Creating a panel for a Premium Rate Number (PRN) service involves building a system that allows you to manage, track, and monetize incoming calls or SMS messages. Here‚Äôs a full breakdown of how to make your own panel, both technically and legally.

üîê Important Note First:
Premium rate services are regulated and must comply with telecom laws in each country. You‚Äôll need:

Agreements with carriers or aggregators

Registered business status

Legal terms & privacy policies

Clear content use (e.g. adult content needs extra approval)

üß± Step-by-Step: Building a PRN Service Panel
1. Get Access to Premium Numbers
You need to partner with an aggregator or a telecom provider that can provide:

Premium rate voice numbers (e.g., 0900, 1-900)

Shortcodes for SMS (e.g., 5-digit SMS codes)

Popular providers:

Infobip

Fortumo

Boku

Mobivate

Dimoka

Twilio (only shortcodes, not voice premium)

2. Define Your Service
What are you offering? (chat, voting, adult content, support, games, etc.)

Voice or SMS based?

One-time or subscription?

3. Build the Admin Panel (Tech Stack)
üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (Web Interface):
Use any web framework:

React, Vue.js, or HTML/CSS/JS

Pages:

Dashboard

Incoming Calls/SMS Logs

Revenue Reports

User Messages

Settings (Keyword management, pricing, auto-reply)

‚öôÔ∏è Backend:
Use Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP (Laravel) or Go

Authentication & roles (admin, support)

APIs to connect with provider (Infobip, Twilio, etc.)

Billing and revenue tracking

Auto-responders for SMS

Logs storage (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

üìû Provider Integration:
Most providers give REST APIs or SMPP gateways:

Receive incoming messages/calls

Send replies

Get delivery receipts

Access usage statistics

Example (Twilio webhook for incoming SMS):

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route("/sms", methods=['POST'])
def sms_reply():
    from_number = request.form['From']
    message_body = request.form['Body']
    # Log and respond
    return f"<Response><Message>Hello, you sent: {message_body}</Message></Response>"
4. Add Billing & Revenue Tracking
Track revenue per number or shortcode

Handle country-wise rate variation

Allow payout tracking if working with partners/resellers

5. Hosting & Security
Use VPS or cloud (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, Hetzner)

SSL (HTTPS), DDoS protection, anti-spam filters

GDPR compliance (if EU traffic involved)

6. Analytics & Notifications
User statistics

Income graphs

Alert system (SMS/email when new messages come in)

7. Extra Features (Optional)
User Panel: Let clients rent your numbers

Webhook forwarding: Forward SMS to client websites

Chatbot with AI for auto SMS replies

Voice IVR with Twilio or Asterisk

‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Compliance Checklist
Register your service with telecom regulators (like Ofcom in UK, FCC in US)

Provide opt-out methods (STOP to unsubscribe)

Clear pricing displayed to users

Adult or sensitive content must be age-gated

‚úÖ Want a Starter Template?
I can generate:

A full React + Node.js boilerplate panel

Or a Django-based admin panel

With simulated data and Twilio/Infobip webhook integration

Let me know your tech preference or whether it‚Äôs SMS or call-focused.
