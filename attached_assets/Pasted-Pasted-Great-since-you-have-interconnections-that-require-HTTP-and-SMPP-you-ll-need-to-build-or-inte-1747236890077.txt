Great ‚Äî since you have interconnections that require HTTP and SMPP, you‚Äôll need to build or integrate both protocols into your premium rate panel.

Here‚Äôs how to handle each:

üåê 1. HTTP Connection (for SMS/Voice APIs)
This is usually used for:

Receiving incoming messages or delivery receipts

Sending outbound SMS (MO/MT)

Responding to incoming calls or SMS with content (chatbots, menus, etc.)

üì• Incoming Message Example (via Webhook)
python
Copy
Edit
@app.route('/incoming_sms', methods=['POST'])
def incoming_sms():
    sender = request.form['from']
    message = request.form['text']
    shortcode = request.form['to']
    
    # Save to database or forward to client
    print(f"Received from {sender} to {shortcode}: {message}")
    
    return "OK", 200
Set this URL in your SMS provider‚Äôs panel as your MO or DLR endpoint.

üì° 2. SMPP Integration (for bulk SMS & direct carrier routes)
SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer) is a binary protocol used for fast SMS messaging with telecom-grade performance. Ideal if you're connected directly to carriers or aggregators.

You can either:

Use open-source SMPP server/client

Or integrate with a library (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)

‚öôÔ∏è SMPP Setup (Client or Server)
Python SMPP Client Example: smpp.pdu
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install smpplib
python
Copy
Edit
import smpplib.client
import smpplib.consts

client = smpplib.client.Client('smpp.host.com', 2775)
client.connect()
client.bind_transceiver(system_id='your_id', password='your_pass')

pdu = client.send_message(
    source_addr='12345',
    dest_addr='447123456789',
    short_message='Hello from SMPP!',
    data_coding=0x03  # Latin1
)
üõ† Recommended Tools and Libraries
Language	SMPP Library	Notes
Python	smpplib, python-smpp	Easy to test with
Node.js	smpp (NPM)	Good for event-based logic
Java	JSMPP	Stable for high-load use
Go	github.com/fiorix/go-smpp	Modern & performant

üí° Tips for Mixed HTTP/SMPP Panel
Allow multiple integrations per route (per number or shortcode)

Build an abstraction layer in your panel that normalizes incoming data (sender, content, shortcode)

Use queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis, Celery) for outbound SMPP handling for high throughput

‚úÖ Next Steps
Would you like:

A code example of a hybrid HTTP + SMPP gateway?

A full panel boilerplate with webhooks + SMPP server logic?
